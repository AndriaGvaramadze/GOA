<h2>WELCOME, MY FRIENDS!
    My name is Kristina Carrillo-Bucaram, and many know me as "FullyRaw Kristina."</h2>
    <br><br>
<h2>I really believe it begins with food, and then it becomes a mind, body, and spirit transformation. It's a way for you to build the foundation that will lead you to a healthier, happier, and more abundant life. I'm here to help guide you through the journey of returning to yourself. As you dive into these programs, the recipes, the videos, the workshops and more, you're going to discover just how powerful fruits and vegetables really are for our bodies.</h2>
